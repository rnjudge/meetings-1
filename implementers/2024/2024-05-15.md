# SPDX Implementers Team Meeting - May 15, 2024

## Attendees
* Nisha Kumar
* Marc-Etienne Vargenau
* Joshua Watt
* Keith Zantow
* Dick Brooks
* Rose Judge

## Notes
* Where are the pain points for SPDX 3 tooling?
  * Idea: "Explorer" - instead of looking at the document, looking at the data that the document has (i.e. specific profiles). Looking at the plain document is overwhelming. The graph nature of json-ld makes sense with a gui.

* Quick Demo: https://github.com/JPEWdev/spdx3query
  * specify as many spdx files as you want on the command line
  * You can interactively browse or there's a handful of single commands
  * extensions: free from object to attach to an element
  * Can filter to look for vulnerability elements and what they affect
  * Primarily focuses on groking the build and security profile
  * https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3.0/annexes/getting-started/ shows you how to write a document from scratch
  * Question: What are you using to go from Python libraries to json-ld model?
    * You can generate python code from the SHACL model
* When might we see v3.0 python parser library?
  * Working on creating an SPDX orgnaization in PyPI
* Dick working on a VDR initiative with the OpenSSF - should know 
* Any tools to merge SPDX documents?
  * Yocto does it in their build tooling not a stand alone
  * Easy to do in SPDX 3: Load each SPDX file; pull out the imports from each file; grab the imports, throw away the SPDX document element and make a new SPDX dcument element that concatenates all the imports you pulled out and then just dump all the elements into a new one.
  * Recursively pull in SPDX documents until there are no more unresolved SPDX IDs
    * Yocto code: https://git.yoctoproject.org/poky-contrib/tree/meta/lib/oe/sbom30.py?h=jpew/spdx-3.0#n699
  * Joshua created POC after the meeting: https://github.com/JPEWdev/spdx3merge
